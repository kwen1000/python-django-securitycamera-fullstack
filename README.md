# python django security camera fullstack

`$ python manage.py runserver` in the security_camera directory to start and go to localhost:8000.

Go to /admin for admin stuff and /home for the live cameras.

Each smartphone can go to /post. From there, nothing else needs to be done other than set them to always be awake.

Admin: kwen, Pass: Frostbite. Or create a new superuser with `$ python manage.py createsuperuser`.
